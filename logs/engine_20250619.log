**Confidence Level 1 (Beginner):**
Two angles are congruent in geometry when they have the same measure. This means that they are equal in size. Just like two triangles are congruent when their sides and angles match up, two angles are congruent when they have the same measurement. So, if two angles have the same number of degrees, they are congruent.
