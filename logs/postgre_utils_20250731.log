Imagine you put some money in a piggy bank. Every year, you earn a fixed amount of extra money on it. This is called *simple interest*. The more years you wait, the more extra money you get, and it always grows at the same rate.

#### Step 1: What Does "Doubles in 8 Years" Mean?

Suppose you start with \$10 (it could be any amount, but let's use 10 for simplicity).

- After 8 years, your money becomes \$20.
- That means you earned \$10 in interest over 8 years.

So, in 8 years, the extra money you get is **equal to what you started with**.

#### Step 2: How Much Do You Earn Each Year?

If you earned \$10 in 8 years, then each year you earn:

\[
\text{Interest per year} = \frac{10}{8} = \$1.25
\]

So, every year, your money grows by \$1.25.

#### Step 3: How Long to Become Five Times as Much?

Now, you want your \$10 to become \$50. That's five times what you started with.

- The extra money you need to earn is \$50 - \$10 = **\$40**.

Since you earn \$1.25 every year, let's see how many years it takes to earn \$40:

\[
\text{Number of years} = \frac{40}{1.25} = 32
\]

So, it will take **32 years** for your money to grow to five times what you started with, if it keeps growing at the same rate.

---

### **In Short**

- If your money doubles in 8 years at simple interest, it will become five times as much in **32 years**.

#### **Why?**

- Because simple interest adds the same amount every year.
- If it takes 8 years to double (add one "extra" original amount), you need 4 more "extras" to reach five times (since you already have the original).
- \( 8 \text{ years} \times 4 = 32 \text{ years} \).

---

### **Final Answer**

**At the same rate of simple interest, your money will become five times as much in 32 years.**

---

#### **Remember**

- Simple interest means you earn the same amount every year.
- To find out how long it takes to grow your money, just see how many "extra" originals you need, and multiply by the years it took to double.

Imagine you are riding your bike. Sometimes you speed up, and sometimes you slow down. If someone asks, "How fast are you going right now?" they want to know your **speed at that exact moment**.

A **derivative** is a math tool that helps us figure out how quickly something is changing at a specific point. It’s like checking your speedometer: not how far you’ve gone in total, but how fast you’re going **right now**.

---

#### Looking at Change: A Simple Example

Suppose you are walking, and you keep track of how far you’ve gone every minute:

- After 1 minute: 2 meters
- After 2 minutes: 4 meters
- After 3 minutes: 6 meters

Each minute, you go 2 more meters. Your **speed** is 2 meters per minute. In math, we call this "speed" the **rate of change**.

---

#### Derivative as Rate of Change

A derivative tells us:

- How much something is changing **right now**.
- For example, if you draw a curve on a graph, the derivative tells you the **slope** (how steep it is) at any point.

Think of the slope as how much you go "up" for every step you go "across."

---

#### A Simple Picture

- If a line is flat, its slope (and derivative) is 0.
- If a line goes up quickly, its slope (and derivative) is large.
- If a line goes down, its slope (and derivative) is negative.

---

#### Another Example: The Slope of a Hill

Imagine you’re climbing a hill:

- If the hill is steep, it’s hard to climb: **big slope** (big derivative).
- If the hill is flat, it’s easy: **small slope** (small derivative).

The derivative tells you how steep the hill is **right where you are standing**.

---

#### In Math Language

If you have a rule, like $y = x^2$, the derivative helps you find out **how fast $y$ is changing** when $x$ changes. For $y = x^2$:

- When $x = 2$, the derivative tells you how quickly $y$ is changing at that spot.

---

#### Why Derivatives Matter

- They help us understand **speed**, **slopes**, and **how things change**.
- They are used in science, engineering, and even in everyday life, like figuring out how fast a car is going at a certain second.

---

#### In Short

- A derivative tells you **how fast something is changing right now**.
- It’s like checking your speedometer while riding a bike: not how far you’ve gone, but how fast you’re going at that moment.
- In math, it’s often called the **slope** at a point on a graph.

---

Keep practicing with simple examples, like lines and curves, and try to think about what is changing and how fast it’s changing. That’s what derivatives are all about!

Let's imagine you have a regular deck of 52 playing cards. You want to know: *If you pick two cards one after the other, without putting the first one back, what are the chances that both are face cards?*

#### 1. **What Are Face Cards?**

Face cards are the Jacks, Queens, and Kings.  
There are 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades), and each suit has a Jack, Queen, and King.

So:
- Number of face cards = 3 (Jack, Queen, King) × 4 (suits) = **12 face cards**

#### 2. **How Many Ways Can You Pick 2 Cards?**

When you pick the first card, there are 52 choices.  
When you pick the second card, there are 51 left.

So, the total number of ways to pick any 2 cards (in any order) is:

$$
52 \times 51
$$

But, picking card A then card B is the same as picking card B then card A (since order doesn't matter). So we divide by 2:

$$
\frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
$$

#### 3. **How Many Ways to Pick 2 Face Cards?**

There are 12 face cards.  
You want to pick 2 of them.

So:

$$
\frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
$$

(Just like above, we divide by 2 because the order doesn't matter.)

#### 4. **Finding the Probability**

Probability is:

$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of good ways}}{\text{Total number of ways}}
$$

So plug in the numbers:

$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{66}{1326}
$$

If we simplify:

$$
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{1}{20}
$$

#### 5. **Final Answer**

So, the chance that both cards are face cards is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}
$$

Or, as a decimal:

$$
0.05
$$

---

**In simple words:**  
If you pick two cards from a deck, you have a 1 out of 20 chance that both are face cards!
