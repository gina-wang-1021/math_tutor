2025-07-28 20:35:39,609 | INFO     | engine | Final Answer for topic-based question → ### Step 1: Understanding Simple Interest Doubling

Suppose the principal is $P$ and the rate of simple interest is $r\%$ per annum.

- In 8 years, the amount becomes double, i.e., $2P$.
- The interest earned in 8 years is $2P - P = P$.

Simple Interest formula:
$$
\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
$$

So,
$$
P = \frac{P \times r \times 8}{100}
$$

Divide both sides by $P$ (since $P \neq 0$):
$$
1 = \frac{r \times 8}{100}
$$

So,
$$
r = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\%
$$

---

### Step 2: Finding the Time to Amount to Five Times

We want the principal to become $5P$.

- Interest earned = $5P - P = 4P$

Using the simple interest formula:
$$
\text{SI} = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
$$

So,
$$
4P = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
$$

Divide both sides by $P$:
$$
4 = \frac{r \times t}{100}
$$

Recall from above: $r = 12.5$

So,
$$
4 = \frac{12.5 \times t}{100}
$$

Multiply both sides by $100$:
$$
400 = 12.5t
$$

So,
$$
t = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

**The sum will amount to five times itself in $32$ years.**

From a standard deck of 52 cards, the number of ways to draw 2 cards (without replacement) is:
\[
\text{Total ways} = {}^{52}C_2 = \frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
\]

---

### Step 2: Number of Ways to Draw 2 Face Cards

There are 3 face cards in each suit (Jack, Queen, King), and 4 suits, so:
\[
\text{Total face cards} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

The number of ways to choose 2 face cards:
\[
\text{Ways to choose 2 face cards} = {}^{12}C_2 = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculating the Probability

The probability that both cards drawn are face cards:
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of ways to draw 2 face cards}}{\text{Total number of ways to draw 2 cards}}
\]
\[
P = \frac{66}{1326} = \frac{33}{663} = \frac{11}{221}
\]

---

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{\frac{11}{221}}
\]

This is the probability that both cards drawn (without replacement) are face cards.

A standard deck of 52 playing cards contains:

- 12 face cards: Jack, Queen, and King of each suit (4 suits × 3 = 12).
- The rest are non-face cards.

### Step 2: Total Ways to Draw 2 Cards

The total number of ways to draw 2 cards from 52 cards is:
\[
\text{Total ways} = {}^{52}C_2 = \frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326

\text{Favorable ways} = {}^{12}C_2 = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the Probability

The required probability is:
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable ways}}{\text{Total number of ways}} = \frac{66}{1326} = \frac{1}{20.09}
\]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{33}{663} = \frac{11}{221}

2025-07-28 20:37:42,859 | INFO     | engine | Second Pass Answer for topic-based question → ### Let's Think About the Problem Step by Step

#### 1. **What Are Face Cards?**

In a regular deck of 52 playing cards, the face cards are the Jacks, Queens, and Kings. Each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) has one Jack, one Queen, and one King.  
So, there are:

- 4 Jacks
- 4 Queens
- 4 Kings

That makes **12 face cards** in total.

---

#### 2. **How Many Ways Can You Pick 2 Cards?**

If you pick any 2 cards from the 52 cards, there are many possible pairs.  
But, for probability, we want to know:

- **How many different pairs of cards can you get?**

You can think of it like:  
First, you pick any card (52 choices),  
then you pick another card (51 choices left).  
But, since the order doesn't matter (picking card A then card B is the same as picking card B then card A), we divide by 2.

So, the total number of ways is:
\[
\frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
\]

---

#### 3. **How Many Ways to Get 2 Face Cards?**

Now, let's only think about the 12 face cards.

- How many ways can you pick 2 face cards?
- Just like before: pick one face card (12 choices), then pick another (11 left), then divide by 2 (since order doesn’t matter):

\[
\frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
\]

---

#### 4. **Finding the Probability**

Probability is just:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of good ways}}{\text{Total number of ways}}
\]

So, for our problem:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{66}{1326}
\]

Let’s make that fraction smaller by dividing both top and bottom by 6:
\[
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{11}{221}
\]

---

#### 5. **Final Answer**

So, the chance that **both cards you pick are face cards** is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{11}{221}}
\]

---

#### 6. **A Simple Example**

Think of it like this: If you had a bag with 52 different marbles, and 12 of them were red (face cards), and you wanted to know the chance of picking 2 red marbles without putting the first one back, you would do the same steps!

---

#### 7. **Summary Table**

| What You Want           | Number of Ways |
|------------------------ |:-------------:|
| Any 2 cards             |     1326      |
| Both are face cards     |      66       |

So, the probability is \( \frac{66}{1326} = \frac{11}{221} \).

2025-07-28 21:03:31,309 | INFO     | engine | Final Answer for topic-based question → ### Step 1: Understanding Simple Interest Doubling

Let the principal (original sum) be $P$, and let the rate of simple interest be $R\%$ per annum.

If the sum doubles in 8 years, then:

- Amount after 8 years = $2P$
- Simple Interest earned in 8 years = $2P - P = P$

The formula for simple interest:
$$
\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
$$

So,
$$
P = \frac{P \times R \times 8}{100}
$$

Dividing both sides by $P$ (since $P \neq 0$):
$$
1 = \frac{R \times 8}{100}
$$

Thus,
$$
R = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\%
$$

---

### Step 2: Finding Time to Amount to Five Times Itself

We want to find $T$ such that the amount becomes $5P$.

- Amount after $T$ years = $5P$
- Simple Interest earned = $5P - P = 4P$

Using the simple interest formula:
$$
\text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
$$

So,
$$
4P = \frac{P \times 12.5 \times T}{100}
$$

Dividing both sides by $P$:
$$
4 = \frac{12.5 \times T}{100}
$$

Solving for $T$:
$$
4 \times 100 = 12.5 \times T \\
400 = 12.5T \\
T = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

**The sum will amount to five times itself in $32$ years at the same rate of simple interest.**

In a standard deck of 52 cards, **face cards** are the Jacks, Queens, and Kings.  
- Each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) has 3 face cards.
- Total number of face cards:  
  $4 \text{ suits} \times 3 = 12$ face cards.

---

### Step 2: Total Number of Ways to Draw 2 Cards

The total number of ways to choose any 2 cards from 52 is:
\[
\text{Total ways} = {}^{52}C_2 = \frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
\]

---

### Step 3: Number of Ways to Draw 2 Face Cards

The number of ways to choose 2 face cards from the 12 available:
\[
\text{Favorable ways} = {}^{12}C_2 = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the Probability

The probability is:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Favorable ways}}{\text{Total ways}} = \frac{66}{1326} = \frac{33}{663} = \frac{11}{221}
\]

---

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{\frac{11}{221}}
\]

This is the probability that both cards drawn (without replacement) are face cards.

- In a standard deck of 52 playing cards, the face cards are **Jacks, Queens, and Kings**.
- Each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) has 3 face cards.
- Total number of face cards: $4 \text{ suits} \times 3 = 12$ face cards.

### Step 2: Calculating the Probability

We want the probability that **both cards drawn (without replacement) are face cards**.

#### Total Number of Ways to Draw 2 Cards

The total number of ways to choose any 2 cards from 52 is:
$$
\text{Total ways} = {52 \choose 2} = \frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
$$

#### Number of Ways to Draw 2 Face Cards

The number of ways to choose 2 face cards from the 12 available is:
$$
\text{Favorable ways} = {12 \choose 2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
$$

#### Calculating the Probability

Therefore, the required probability is:
$$
P = \frac{\text{Favorable ways}}{\text{Total ways}} = \frac{66}{1326}
$$

Simplify the fraction:
$$
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{33}{663} = \frac{11}{221}
$$

### Final Answer

**The probability that both cards are face cards is:**
$$
\boxed{\frac{11}{221}}
$$

Let the principal (original sum) be $P$, the rate of interest per annum be $R\%$, and the time to double be $8$ years.

At simple interest, the amount after $n$ years is:
$$
A = P + SI = P + \left(\frac{P \times R \times n}{100}\right)
$$

Given that the sum doubles in $8$ years:
$$
A = 2P \\
2P = P + \left(\frac{P \times R \times 8}{100}\right) \\
2P - P = \frac{P \times R \times 8}{100} \\
P = \frac{P \times R \times 8}{100}
$$

Divide both sides by $P$:
$$
1 = \frac{R \times 8}{100} \\
R \times 8 = 100 \\
R = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\%
$$

So, the rate of interest is $12.5\%$ per annum.

---

### Step 2: Finding the Time to Become Five Times

Let the required time be $n$ years.

We want the amount to be $5$ times the principal:
$$
A = 5P \\
5P = P + \left(\frac{P \times R \times n}{100}\right) \\
5P - P = \frac{P \times R \times n}{100} \\
4P = \frac{P \times R \times n}{100}
$$

Divide both sides by $P$:
$$
4 = \frac{R \times n}{100}
$$

Substitute $R = 12.5$:
$$
4 = \frac{12.5 \times n}{100} \\
4 \times 100 = 12.5 \times n \\
400 = 12.5n \\
n = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

**The sum will amount to five times itself in $32$ years at the same rate of simple interest.**

2025-07-28 21:38:25,261 | INFO     | engine | Final Answer for topic-based question → ### Step 1: Find the Total Number of Ways to Draw 2 Cards

A standard deck has 52 cards.  
The number of ways to draw 2 cards from 52 is:
\[
\text{Total ways} = {}^{52}C_2 = \frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
\]

---

### Step 2: Find the Number of Ways to Draw 2 Face Cards

Face cards are Jacks, Queens, and Kings.  
There are 3 face cards per suit and 4 suits:
\[
\text{Total face cards} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

Ways to choose 2 face cards from 12:
\[
\text{Favorable ways} = {}^{12}C_2 = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability

The probability is:
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{66}{1326}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{1}{20.09} \approx \frac{1}{20}
\]

Or, as a fraction:
\[
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{1}{20.09}
\]
But $66 \times 20 = 1320$, so $66/1326$ reduces to $33/663$ (divide by 2), then $11/221$ (divide by 3).

So, the simplest form is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{11}{221}}
\]

---

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{\frac{11}{221}}
\]

This is the probability that both cards drawn (without replacement) are face cards.

2025-07-28 21:43:26,539 | INFO     | engine | First Pass Answer for topic-based question → ### Step 1: Understanding Simple Interest Doubling

Let the original sum be $P$ and the rate of simple interest be $r\%$ per annum.

When the sum doubles in 8 years, the amount becomes $2P$.

Simple interest formula:
\[
\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
\]

Total amount after $t$ years:
\[
A = P + \text{SI}
\]

So, after 8 years:
\[
2P = P + \frac{P \times r \times 8}{100}
\]

Subtract $P$ from both sides:
\[
P = \frac{P \times r \times 8}{100}
\]

Divide both sides by $P$ (assuming $P \neq 0$):
\[
1 = \frac{r \times 8}{100}
\]

\[
r = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\%
\]

---

### Step 2: Finding Time to Amount to Five Times

Now, we want the sum to become $5P$ at the same rate.

So,
\[
5P = P + \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
\]

\[
5P - P = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
\]
\[
4P = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
\]

Divide both sides by $P$:
\[
4 = \frac{r \times t}{100}
\]

Recall from earlier: $r = 12.5$
\[
4 = \frac{12.5 \times t}{100}
\]

Multiply both sides by 100:
\[
400 = 12.5t
\]

\[
t = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
\]

---

### **Final Answer**

**The sum will amount to five times itself in $32$ years at the same rate of simple interest.**

2025-07-28 21:43:35,969 | INFO     | engine | Second Pass Answer for topic-based question → #### Let’s Break Down the Problem Step by Step

Let’s imagine you put some money in a bank, and the bank pays you simple interest every year. Simple interest means you earn the same amount of interest every year, based on your original money (called the “principal”).

Let’s call your original money \$P\$.

---

### 1. Understanding How the Money Doubles

We are told that your money doubles in 8 years. That means, after 8 years, you have twice as much as you started with.

- If you started with \$P\$, after 8 years you have \$2P\$.

The extra money you get is called **interest**. So, in 8 years, you earned another \$P\$ as interest.

#### How much interest do you get each year?

Let’s use the simple interest formula, which you might have seen before:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Or,

\[
\text{Interest} = P \times r \times t
\]

where:
- \$P\$ is the money you started with,
- \$r\$ is the rate (as a decimal for now),
- \$t\$ is the number of years.

But we usually write the rate as a percent, so the formula is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
\]

We know after 8 years, the total interest is \$P\$, so:

\[
P = \frac{P \times r \times 8}{100}
\]

Let’s divide both sides by \$P\$ (since it’s not zero):

\[
1 = \frac{r \times 8}{100}
\]

Now, solve for \$r\$:

\[
r \times 8 = 100
\]
\[
r = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5
\]

So, the interest rate is **12.5% per year**.

---

### 2. When Will the Money Become Five Times as Much?

Now the question is: **How long will it take for your money to become five times what you started with?**

- If you start with \$P\$, you want to have \$5P\$.

That means, the interest you earn is \$5P - P = 4P\$.

So, you want to earn \$4P\$ as interest.

Let’s use the simple interest formula again:

\[
\text{Interest} = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
\]

Set this equal to \$4P\$:

\[
4P = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
\]

Again, divide both sides by \$P\$:

\[
4 = \frac{r \times t}{100}
\]

We already found that \$r = 12.5\$.

Plug that in:

\[
4 = \frac{12.5 \times t}{100}
\]

Now, solve for \$t\$:

First, multiply both sides by 100:

\[
400 = 12.5 \times t
\]

Now, divide both sides by 12.5:

\[
t = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
\]

---

#### **Final Answer**

**It will take 32 years for your money to become five times as much at the same simple interest rate.**

---

#### **Let’s Summarize with a Simple Example**

- If you put in \$100, after 8 years you’d have \$200 (it doubles).
- The rate is 12.5% per year.
- To make your \$100 become \$500 (five times), you need to wait 32 years.

**Remember:**  
With simple interest, your money grows at the same steady rate every year, so you can use simple math to figure out how long it takes to reach any amount!

Now the question is: **How long will it take for your money to become five times what you started with?**

- If you start with \$P\$, you want to have \$5P\$.

\]

Now, solve for \$t\$:

First, multiply both sides by 100:

\[
400 = 12.5 \times t
\]

Now, divide both sides by 12.5:

\[
t = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
\]

**It will take 32 years for your money to become five times as much at the same simple interest rate.**

Suppose you have a normal deck of playing cards. There are 52 cards in total.

#### **Step 1: What are Face Cards?**

Face cards are the Jacks, Queens, and Kings. Each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) has one Jack, one Queen, and one King.

- Number of face cards in each suit: 3
- Number of suits: 4
- So, total face cards: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

#### **Step 2: How Many Ways to Pick 2 Cards?**

Imagine you just want to pick any 2 cards from the deck. 

- First card: 52 choices (since the deck has 52 cards)
- Second card: 51 choices (because you already took one out)

But, if you pick card A first and card B second, or card B first and card A second, that's the same pair. So we divide by 2 to avoid counting the same pair twice.

So, total ways to pick any 2 cards:
\[
\frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
\]

#### **Step 3: How Many Ways to Pick 2 Face Cards?**

Now, let's only look at the face cards.

- There are 12 face cards.
- First face card: 12 choices
- Second face card: 11 choices (since one is already taken)

Again, divide by 2 for the same reason as before.

So, ways to pick 2 face cards:
\[
\frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
\]

#### **Step 4: Find the Probability**

Probability is like asking: "Out of all the possible pairs of cards, how many are both face cards?"

So,
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of ways to pick 2 face cards}}{\text{Number of ways to pick any 2 cards}}
\]
\[
= \frac{66}{1326}
\]

Let's make this fraction simpler. Both 66 and 1326 can be divided by 66:

\[
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{1}{20.09} \approx \frac{1}{20}
\]

#### **Final Answer**

So, if you pick two cards from a deck, the chance that both are face cards is about:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}
\]

or about 1 out of 20 times.

**Remember:**  
- Probability is just "favorable outcomes" divided by "all possible outcomes."
- Here, "favorable" means both cards are face cards.

2025-07-28 21:50:47,035 | INFO     | engine | Compared answer: ### Let's Figure Out the Probability Together!

Suppose you have a normal deck of playing cards. There are 52 cards in total.

#### **Step 1: What are Face Cards?**

Face cards are the Jacks, Queens, and Kings. Each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) has one Jack, one Queen, and one King.

- Number of face cards in each suit: 3
- Number of suits: 4
- So, total face cards: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

#### **Step 2: How Many Ways to Pick 2 Cards?**

Imagine you just want to pick any 2 cards from the deck. 

- First card: 52 choices (since the deck has 52 cards)
- Second card: 51 choices (because you already took one out)

But, if you pick card A first and card B second, or card B first and card A second, that's the same pair. So we divide by 2 to avoid counting the same pair twice.

So, total ways to pick any 2 cards:
\[
\frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
\]

#### **Step 3: How Many Ways to Pick 2 Face Cards?**

Now, let's only look at the face cards.

- There are 12 face cards.
- First face card: 12 choices
- Second face card: 11 choices (since one is already taken)

Again, divide by 2 for the same reason as before.

So, ways to pick 2 face cards:
\[
\frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
\]

#### **Step 4: Find the Probability**

Probability is like asking: "Out of all the possible pairs of cards, how many are both face cards?"

So,
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of ways to pick 2 face cards}}{\text{Number of ways to pick any 2 cards}}
\]
\[
= \frac{66}{1326}
\]

Let's make this fraction simpler. Both 66 and 1326 can be divided by 66:

\[
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{1}{20.09} \approx \frac{1}{20}
\]

#### **Final Answer**

So, if you pick two cards from a deck, the chance that both are face cards is about:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}
\]

or about 1 out of 20 times.

**Remember:**  
- Probability is just "favorable outcomes" divided by "all possible outcomes."
- Here, "favorable" means both cards are face cards.

2025-07-28 22:04:56,950 | INFO     | engine | Final Answer for topic-based question → ### Understanding the Problem

We are working with a standard deck of 52 cards. A **face card** refers to the Jack, Queen, or King in each suit. There are 3 face cards per suit and 4 suits, so:

- **Number of face cards:** $3 \times 4 = 12$

We want the probability that **both** cards drawn (without replacement) are face cards.

---

### Step 1: Total Number of Ways to Draw 2 Cards

The total number of ways to draw 2 cards from 52 is:

\[
\text{Total ways} = \binom{52}{2} = \frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
\]

---

### Step 2: Number of Favorable Ways (Both Face Cards)

The number of ways to choose 2 face cards from the 12 face cards is:

\[
\text{Favorable ways} = \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculating the Probability

Using the formula for probability with equally likely outcomes:

\[
P(\text{both are face cards}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P = \frac{66}{1326}
\]

This fraction can be simplified:

\[
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{1}{20.09} \approx \frac{1}{20}
\]

But let's simplify exactly:

\[
66 \div 66 = 1 \\
1326 \div 66 = 20.09
\]

But $66 \times 20 = 1320$, so $1326/66 = 20.09...$

So, the simplified fraction is:

\[
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{33}{663} = \frac{11}{221}
\]

---

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{\frac{11}{221}}
\]

This is the probability that both cards drawn without replacement from a standard deck are face cards.

2025-07-28 22:06:56,052 | INFO     | engine | Final Answer for topic-based question → ### Solution

Let's use the concept of **simple interest** to solve the problem.

#### Step 1: Understanding Doubling at Simple Interest

Let the principal (original sum) be $P$.

Let the rate of interest per year be $r\%$.

If the sum **doubles** in 8 years, then:

- The amount after 8 years = $2P$
- The simple interest earned in 8 years = $2P - P = P$

Simple interest formula:
$$
\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}
$$

So,
$$
P = \frac{P \times r \times 8}{100}
$$

Divide both sides by $P$ (assuming $P \neq 0$):
$$
1 = \frac{r \times 8}{100}
$$

So,
$$
r = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\%
$$

#### Step 2: Finding Years to Amount to Five Times Itself

We want the sum to become $5P$.

- Amount after $n$ years = $5P$
- So, SI in $n$ years = $5P - P = 4P$

Using the simple interest formula:
$$
\text{SI} = \frac{P \times r \times n}{100}
$$

So,
$$
4P = \frac{P \times 12.5 \times n}{100}
$$

Divide both sides by $P$:
$$
4 = \frac{12.5 \times n}{100}
$$

Multiply both sides by 100:
$$
400 = 12.5n
$$

So,
$$
n = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

**The sum will amount to five times itself in $32$ years.**

Let the principal (initial sum) be $P$.  
Let the rate of simple interest per year be $r\%$.

#### Step 1: Find the Rate of Interest

The sum doubles in 8 years.  
So, Amount after 8 years $= 2P$

Using the simple interest formula:
$$
\text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \text{Principal} \times \frac{\text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{100}
$$

Amount after $n$ years:
$$
A = P + SI = P + P \times \frac{r \times n}{100}
$$

For $n = 8$ years and $A = 2P$,
\[
2P = P + P \times \frac{r \times 8}{100}
\]
\[
2P - P = P \times \frac{r \times 8}{100}
\]
\[
P = P \times \frac{r \times 8}{100}
\]
\[
1 = \frac{r \times 8}{100}
\]
\[
r \times 8 = 100
\]
\[
r = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\%
\]

---

#### Step 2: Find the Time to Amount to Five Times

Let the required time be $n$ years, so that the amount becomes $5P$.

Using the same formula:
\[
A = P + P \times \frac{r \times n}{100}
\]
\[
5P = P + P \times \frac{12.5 \times n}{100}
\]
\[
5P - P = P \times \frac{12.5 \times n}{100}
\]
\[
4P = P \times \frac{12.5 \times n}{100}
\]
\[
4 = \frac{12.5 \times n}{100}
\]
\[
12.5n = 400
\]
\[
n = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
\]

---

### **Final Answer**

**The sum will amount to five times itself in $32$ years at the same rate of simple interest.**

Suppose you have some money, let's call it \$P (this is just a way to talk about "the sum" without picking a number). You put this money in a place where it earns simple interest every year.

**Simple interest** means you earn the same amount of interest every year, based only on the starting money (the "principal").

---

### Step 1: How Long Does It Take to Double?

We are told that after 8 years, your money doubles.  
So, if you started with \$100 (just an example), after 8 years you would have \$200.

That means the *interest* you earned in 8 years is also \$100 (since \$200 - \$100 = \$100).

#### How much interest do you earn each year?

Since it's the same amount every year:
- Total interest in 8 years = \$100
- So, interest each year = \$100 ÷ 8 = \$12.50 per year

This means every year, you get \$12.50 for every \$100 you put in. That's **12.5% interest per year**.

---

### Step 2: How Long to Make It Five Times Bigger?

Now, we want to know: how many years will it take for your money to become *five times* what you started with?

If you started with \$100, you want to end up with \$500.

- The total interest you need to earn is \$500 - \$100 = \$400

Remember, each year you earn \$12.50 for every \$100 you started with.

#### How many years to get \$400 in interest?

- Each year: \$12.50
- Total needed: \$400

So,
\[
\text{Number of years} = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
\]

---

### Step 3: **Conclusion**

**It will take 32 years for your money to become five times bigger at the same simple interest rate.**

---

#### **Quick Recap**

- Simple interest gives you the same amount every year.
- If your money doubles in 8 years, the interest rate is 12.5% per year.
- To make your money five times bigger, you need 32 years at the same rate.

Remember, each year you earn \$12.50 for every \$100 you started with.

#### How many years to get \$400 in interest?

- Each year: \$12.50
- Total needed: \$400

So,
\[
\text{Number of years} = \frac{400}{12.5} = 32
\]

---

### Step 3: **Conclusion**

**It will take 32 years for your money to become five times bigger at the same simple interest rate.**

---

#### **Quick Recap**

- Simple interest gives you the same amount every year.
- If your money doubles in 8 years, the interest rate is 12.5% per year.
- To make your money five times bigger, you need 32 years at the same rate.

2025-07-28 22:18:52,757 | INFO     | engine | First Pass Answer for topic-based question → ### Step 1: Total Number of Ways to Draw 2 Cards

A standard deck has 52 cards.  
The number of ways to draw 2 cards from 52 (without replacement) is:
\[
\text{Total ways} = \binom{52}{2} = \frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
\]

---

### Step 2: Number of Ways to Draw 2 Face Cards

Face cards are the Jacks, Queens, and Kings.  
There are 3 face cards per suit, and 4 suits, so:
\[
\text{Total face cards} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]
Number of ways to choose 2 face cards:
\[
\text{Ways to choose 2 face cards} = \binom{12}{2} = \frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
\]

---

### Step 3: Probability Calculation

Probability is given by:
\[
P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
\]
So,
\[
P = \frac{66}{1326} = \frac{1}{20.09} \approx 0.049
\]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[
\frac{66}{1326} = \frac{1}{20.09} \approx \frac{1}{20}
\]

---

### **Final Answer**

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}
\]

So, the probability that both cards drawn are face cards is $\frac{1}{20}$.

2025-07-28 22:19:26,279 | INFO     | engine | Second Pass Answer for topic-based question → ### Let's Solve the Problem Step By Step!

Suppose you have a standard deck of 52 playing cards. You want to know:  
*If you pick two cards one after the other (without putting the first card back), what is the chance that both are face cards?*

---

#### **Step 1: What Are Face Cards?**

Face cards are the cards with faces on them:  
- Jack (J)  
- Queen (Q)  
- King (K)  

Each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) has one of each, so:

- J, Q, K of hearts  
- J, Q, K of diamonds  
- J, Q, K of clubs  
- J, Q, K of spades  

That’s **3 face cards per suit × 4 suits = 12 face cards** in the deck.

---

#### **Step 2: How Many Ways to Pick 2 Face Cards?**

Think about picking the first card:

- There are **12 face cards** you could get first.

Now, pick the second card (remember, you don’t put the first card back):

- There are now **11 face cards** left.

So, the number of ways to pick 2 face cards in a row is:
$$
12 \times 11 = 132
$$

But, since the order doesn’t matter (picking King then Queen is the same as Queen then King), we divide by 2:
$$
\frac{12 \times 11}{2} = 66
$$

---

#### **Step 3: How Many Ways to Pick Any 2 Cards?**

There are 52 cards at first, then 51 left after picking one.  
So, the number of ways to pick any 2 cards is:
$$
52 \times 51 = 2652
$$

Again, order doesn’t matter, so divide by 2:
$$
\frac{52 \times 51}{2} = 1326
$$

---

#### **Step 4: Find the Probability**

Probability is:
$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of ways to get 2 face cards}}{\text{Number of ways to get any 2 cards}}
$$

So,
$$
\frac{66}{1326}
$$

If we simplify this fraction (divide both top and bottom by 66):
$$
\frac{66 \div 66}{1326 \div 66} = \frac{1}{20.09} \approx \frac{1}{20}
$$

---

#### **Final Answer**

**The chance of picking two face cards in a row (without putting the first back) is:**

$$
\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}
$$

So, out of every 20 times you try, you can expect to get two face cards once!
