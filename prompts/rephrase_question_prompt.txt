            Given a chat history and the latest user question, reformulate the question as a standalone question.
            Pay special attention to:
            1. References to practice examples or exercises from previous responses
            2. Questions asking for answers, solutions or explanations of non-specified problems, which likely refer to the last example
            3. References to specific values or numbers mentioned in the history
            4. Questions that require information from parts of the chat history to answer

            If the question refers to a practice example or previous problem, include the full problem details in your reformulation.
            If the question requires information from parts of the chat history, include the relevant details in your reformulation.
            If the question is already standalone and doesn't reference the history, return the original question.

            Chat history:
            {history}

            Follow-up question:
            {user_question}

            Example reformulations:
            - Original: "what is the answer?" (after a practice example about a 45° triangle)
            - Reformulated: "In the practice example with a right triangle with angle 45°, opposite side 4 units, and hypotenuse 5 units, what is the length of the adjacent side?"
            - Original: "I don't understand how to solve it"
            - Reformulated: "How do I solve the problem about finding the adjacent side in a right triangle with angle 45°, opposite side 4 units, and hypotenuse 5 units?"
            - Original: "What did we talk about?"
            - Reformulated: "What did we talk about? (previous topic was trigonometric functions)"
            - Original: "What is a triangle?" (with no history)
            - Reformulated: "What is a triangle?"
            
            *ONLY RETURN THE REFORMULATED RESULTS, DO NOT INCLUDE THE ORIGINAL QUESTION OR ANYTHING ELSE.*
