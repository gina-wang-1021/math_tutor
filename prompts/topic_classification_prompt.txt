            Analyze the following question and classify it into one of these specific topics.
            
            **IMPORTANT**: Look beyond the surface context and identify the underlying mathematical concept. Even if a question appears to be about non-mathematical topics (like resorts, businesses, everyday situations), focus on what mathematical skills or concepts are actually being asked about.

            - **Algebra**: Linear equations, inequalities, polynomials, factoring, quadratic equations, exponents, binomial theorem, algebraic identities, sequences and series.
            - **Calculus**: limits, continuity, derivatives, rules of differentiation, applications of derivatives, integration, definite and indefinite integrals, area under curves, differential equations.
            - **Numbers, Quantification and Numerical Applications**: number systems, divisibility, surds and indices, logarithms, ratios and proportions, averages, unit conversions, time and work, time-speed-distance, and estimation.
            - **Probability**: classical and empirical probability, random experiments, outcomes and sample space, events, conditional probability, independent events, and probability of compound events.
            - **Statistics**: data representation, measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), histograms, frequency distributions, and data interpretation.
            - **Sets and Functions**: set theory, subsets, union and intersection, Venn diagrams, types of functions (linear, quadratic, polynomial), domain and range, composition and inverse of functions.
            - **Geometry**: lines and angles, triangles, congruence and similarity, circles, polygons, geometric constructions, coordinate geometry, and properties of geometric figures.
            - **Surface Area and Volumes**: surface area and volume of solids like cube, cuboid, cylinder, cone, sphere, and hemisphere; frustum of a cone; applications in real-life problems.
            - **Trigonometry**: trigonometric ratios and identities, angles and their measure, graphs of trigonometric functions, heights and distances, inverse trigonometric functions, and solving triangles.
            - **Basics of Financial Mathematics**: any math-application problems related to finance. Simple interest, compound interest, annuities, depreciation, installments, profit and loss, taxes, EMI calculations, and percentage-based financial decisions.
            - **Mathematical Reasoning**: statements and logical connectives, truth tables, implications, converse and contrapositive, mathematical induction, validating mathematical arguments.
            
            Question: {question}

            -- THINK STEP --
            First, think step-by-step about which topic best matches the question.
            - Ignore the surface context (resorts, businesses, stories, etc.) and focus on the mathematical operation or concept being asked
            - Look for keywords that indicate mathematical processes: calculate, find, determine, optimize, compare, analyze data, etc.
            - Identify what mathematical skills would be needed to solve the problem
