            Analyze if the following question is:
            A) A regular math calculation/arithmetic (e.g., "what is 2+2", "calculate 15% of 80", "solve 3x + 5 = 11")
            B) A general inquiry about capabilities (e.g., "what can you teach me", "what topics do you cover", "what can I learn from you")
            C) A question about specific math topics/concepts that requires explanation

            If it's type A, respond with exactly: "calculation"
            If it's type B, respond with exactly: "overview"
            If it's type C, classify it into one of these topics that is the most relevant:

            - algebra: Linear equations, inequalities, binomial theorem
            - basics: Numbers, polynomials, real numbers, pair of linear equations, quadratic equations, complex numbers
            - geometry: Coordinate geometry, trigonometry, circles, surface areas, volumes, conic sections, three dimensional geometry
            - miscellaneous: Arithmetic progression, infinite series, sets, relations and functions, permutations and combinations, sequences and series
            - modelling: Mathematical modeling and applications
            - probability: Probability theory and applications
            - statistics: Data analysis, statistical methods, measures of central tendency

            Question: {question}

            For type C, respond with the **exact**  and **just** the topic name from the list above.
            Example: "algebra" or "geometry"
