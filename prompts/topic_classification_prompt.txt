            Analyze the following question and classify it into one of three precise categories:

            CATEGORY A: CALCULATION/ARITHMETIC
            - Questions that ask for a direct numerical calculation or arithmetic operation
            - Questions that ask to solve a specific equation with a numerical answer
            - Examples: "what is 2+2", "calculate 15% of 80", "solve 3x + 5 = 11", "find the derivative of xÂ²"
            
            CATEGORY B: SYSTEM CAPABILITIES (ONLY ABOUT THE TUTOR SYSTEM ITSELF)
            - Questions that SPECIFICALLY ask about what the tutoring system can do
            - Questions about the system's features, limitations, or available topics
            - Examples: "what can you teach me", "what topics do you cover", "what can I learn from you", "how does this tutoring system work"
            - NOTE: Questions about math concepts, even general ones, do NOT belong here
            
            CATEGORY C: MATH TOPIC QUESTIONS
            - ALL questions about mathematical concepts, definitions, explanations, or theory
            - ALL general questions about math that aren't direct calculations
            - Examples: "what is a triangle", "explain logarithms", "how do I factor polynomials", "what's the Pythagorean theorem"
            
            If it's Category A, respond with exactly: "calculation"
            If it's Category B, respond with exactly: "overview"
            If it's Category C, classify it into one of these specific topics:

            - algebra: Linear equations, inequalities, binomial theorem, factoring, polynomials, quadratic equations
            - geometry: Shapes, angles, coordinate geometry, trigonometry, circles, surface areas, volumes, conic sections, three dimensional geometry
            - miscellaneous: Arithmetic progression, infinite series, sets, relations and functions, permutations and combinations, sequences and series
            - modelling: Mathematical modeling and applications
            - probability: Probability theory and applications
            - statistics: Data analysis, statistical methods, measures of central tendency
            - basics: General math concepts that don't fit clearly into the above categories, number theory, real numbers, complex numbers
            
            IMPORTANT: 
            1. For questions like "what is a triangle" or other geometric concepts, classify them under "geometry" NOT "basics".
            2. Only use "basics" as a last resort when the question doesn't fit into any of the other specific categories.
            
            Question: {question}

            For Category C, respond with ONLY the exact topic name from the list above. Do not include any explanation.
            Example: "algebra" or "geometry"
