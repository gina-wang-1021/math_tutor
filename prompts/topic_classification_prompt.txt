            Analyze the following question and classify it into one of three precise categories:

            CATEGORY A: CALCULATION/ARITHMETIC
            - Questions that ask for a direct numerical calculation or arithmetic operation
            - Questions that ask to solve a specific equation with a numerical answer
            - Examples: "what is 2+2", "calculate 15% of 80", "solve 3x + 5 = 11", "find the derivative of xÂ²"
            
            CATEGORY B: MATH TOPIC QUESTIONS
            - ALL questions about mathematical concepts, definitions, explanations, or theory
            - ALL general questions about math that aren't direct calculations
            - Examples: "what is a triangle", "explain logarithms", "how do I factor polynomials", "what's the Pythagorean theorem"
            
            If it's Category A, respond with exactly: "calculation"
            If it's Category B, classify it into one of these specific topics:

            - Algebra: Linear equations, inequalities, polynomials, factoring, quadratic equations, exponents, binomial theorem, algebraic identities, sequences and series.
            - Basics of Financial Mathematics: any math-application problems related to finance. Simple interest, compound interest, annuities, depreciation, installments, profit and loss, taxes, EMI calculations, and percentage-based financial decisions.
            - Calculus: limits, continuity, derivatives, rules of differentiation, applications of derivatives, integration, definite and indefinite integrals, area under curves, differential equations.
            - Geometry: lines and angles, triangles, congruence and similarity, circles, polygons, geometric constructions, coordinate geometry, and properties of geometric figures.
            - Mathematical Reasoning: statements and logical connectives, truth tables, implications, converse and contrapositive, mathematical induction, validating mathematical arguments.
            - Numbers Quantification and Numerical Applications: number systems, divisibility, surds and indices, logarithms, ratios and proportions, averages, unit conversions, time and work, time-speed-distance, and estimation.
            - Probability: classical and empirical probability, random experiments, outcomes and sample space, events, conditional probability, independent events, and probability of compound events.
            - Statistics: data representation, measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), histograms, frequency distributions, and data interpretation.
            - Set and Functions: set theory, subsets, union and intersection, Venn diagrams, types of functions (linear, quadratic, polynomial), domain and range, composition and inverse of functions.
            - Surface Area and Volumes: surface area and volume of solids like cube, cuboid, cylinder, cone, sphere, and hemisphere; frustum of a cone; applications in real-life problems.
            - Trigonometry: trigonometric ratios and identities, angles and their measure, graphs of trigonometric functions, heights and distances, inverse trigonometric functions, and solving triangles.
            
            Question: {question}

            For Category B, respond with ONLY the exact topic name from the list above. Do not include any explanation.
            Example: "Algebra" or "Numbers Quantification and Numerical Applications"
