            Analyze the following question and classify it into one of these specific economics topics.
            
            **IMPORTANT**: Look beyond the surface context and identify the underlying economic concept. Even if a question appears to be about non-economic topics (like personal stories, general business situations), focus on what economic principles or concepts are actually being asked about.

            - **Introduction to Economics**: Basic economic concepts, scarcity, choice, opportunity cost, economic systems, factors of production, economic activities, needs vs wants, and fundamental economic problems.
            - **Consumer Behavior and Demand**: Consumer preferences, utility theory, demand curves, law of demand, factors affecting demand, elasticity of demand, consumer surplus, and consumer equilibrium.
            - **Producer Behavior and Supply**: Production theory, costs of production, supply curves, law of supply, factors affecting supply, elasticity of supply, producer surplus, and producer equilibrium.
            - **Market Equilibrium**: Market forces, price determination, equilibrium price and quantity, shifts in demand and supply, market efficiency, and price controls.
            - **Collection, Organisation and Presentation of data**: Data collection methods, surveys, sampling techniques, data organization, tabulation, graphical representation, frequency distributions, and data presentation formats.
            - **Statistical Tools and Interpretation**: Measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, correlation, regression analysis, index numbers, time series analysis, and statistical interpretation of economic data.
            
            Question: {question}

            -- THINK STEP --
            First, think step-by-step about which topic best matches the question.
            - Ignore the surface context (personal stories, general business scenarios, etc.) and focus on the economic concept or principle being asked
            - Look for keywords that indicate economic processes: demand, supply, price, market, consumer, producer, data analysis, etc.
            - Identify what economic knowledge would be needed to answer the question
            
            -- OUTPUT FORMAT --
            Return your answer as a Python list with exactly two elements:
            [classification, reasoning]
            
            Where:
            - classification: The exact topic name from the list above, or "None" if no economic concept applies
            - reasoning: A brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of why you chose this classification
            
            Example format: ["Consumer Behavior and Demand", "This question involves analyzing how consumers respond to price changes."]
