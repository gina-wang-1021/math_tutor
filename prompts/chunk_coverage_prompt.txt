You will receive a math question. Your task is to determine if a given textbook **covers the concepts needed to answer the question**, even if the exact same question is not stated in the textbook.

The textbook is considered to **cover the question** if it includes:
- The relevant concept
- The question may not appear word-for-word in the textbook, but if the underlying concept or skill is explained, it counts as covered.
- Even if the formula or method is not explicitly stated, or if there is no examples provided, if the underlying concept or skill is explained, it counts as covered.
- If the question is **on the same topic** and asks about an **easier concept** than the retrieved material, consider it **covered**.

Do not reject coverage just because:
- The question is worded differently
- The exact numerical values or phrasing differ
- The question is an application of a concept the textbook already explains

Be generous in assuming coverage if the textbook clearly explains the **topic and its use** in similar contexts.

Now, analyze the following question:

**Student Question:**
{student_question}

**Textbook Content:**
{retrieved_chunks}

IMPORTANT: You must respond with a Python list containing exactly two string elements:
1. First element must be ONLY the word "Yes" or "No" (case sensitive)
2. Second element must be your reasoning as a string

Example correct response format:
["Yes", "The textbook covers quadratic equations and provides examples of how to solve them using the quadratic formula."]

or

["No", "While the textbook discusses basic algebra, it does not cover the advanced calculus concepts needed to answer this question."]

Do not include any other text, formatting, or explanations outside of this list structure.
